The header file <asm/ioctl.h>, which is included by <linux/ioctl.h>, defines 
macros that help set up the command numbers as follows: 

_IO(type,nr)                  (for a command that has no argument), 
_IOR(type,nr,datatype)        (for reading data from the driver), 
_IOW(type,nr,datatype)        (for writing data), and 
_IOWR(type,nr,datatype)       (for bidirectional transfers). 

The type and number fields are passed as arguments, and the size field is 
derived by applying sizeof to the datatype argument.
